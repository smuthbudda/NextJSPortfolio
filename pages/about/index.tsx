                    Hi, I'm Jordan!
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    I am a software developer currently based in Melbourne, VIC, Australia. In January 2022, I made the decision to move  from my hometown of Calgary, Alberta, Canada, to accompany my partner on her three-year trip to Australia while she completes her post graduate degree. I am excited to explore new opportunities in this vibrant city and further develop my skills in the field.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    During my Bachelor's degree at the University of Calgary, I pursued Economics as my major. However, a single class in Computer Science opened my eyes to the potential of programming, inspiring me to complete a minor in the field. After graduation, I realized that I wanted to enhance my programming skills and decided to pursue a career in software development. It is this drive that led me to my current role as a developer at SafeCode, where I utilize my programming to create innovative solutions for clients.
